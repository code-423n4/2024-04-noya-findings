In the file `contracts/governance/Keepers.sol`, the function `execute()` validates if `threshold` owners have approved the transaction before executing the transaction. Line 103 sets `address lastAdd = address(0);` and Line 106 `require(recovered > lastAdd && isOwner[recovered]);` sets a required order of the recovered address: only addresses in ascending order will be accepted.

The executor should take care of this order to avoid a failed transaction. If this transaction is urgent, a potential failure might lead to serious consequences. For example, if an urgent undo transaction is needed, failed to call the function in a limited timeframe might lead to unforeseen results. I suggest using the modified function below:

```solidity
function execute(
    address destination,
    bytes calldata data,
    uint256 gasLimit,
    address executor,
    bytes32[] memory sigR,
    bytes32[] memory sigS,
    uint8[] memory sigV,
    uint256 deadline
) public {
    require(isOwner[msg.sender], "Not an owner");
    require(sigR.length == threshold, "Not enough signatures");
    require(sigR.length == sigS.length && sigR.length == sigV.length, "Lengths do not match");
    require(executor == msg.sender, "Invalid executor");
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Transaction expired");

    bytes32 txInputHash = keccak256(abi.encode(TXTYPE_HASH, nonce, destination, data, gasLimit, executor, deadline));
    bytes32 totalHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", _domainSeparatorV4(), txInputHash));

    // Create an array to track seen addresses
    address[] memory seen = new address[](threshold);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < threshold;) {
        address recovered = ECDSA.recover(totalHash, sigV[i], sigR[i], sigS[i]);
        require(isOwner[recovered], "Invalid signer");

        // Check if the address is already seen
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            require(seen[j] != recovered, "Duplicate signer");
        }

        seen[i] = recovered;
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }

    nonce++;
    emit Execute(destination, data, gasLimit, executor, deadline);
    (bool success,) = destination.call{ gas: gasLimit }(data);
    require(success, "Transaction execution reverted.");
}
```
