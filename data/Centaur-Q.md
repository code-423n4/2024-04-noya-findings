## [QA] : Informational Findings on NoyaFeeReceiver.sol

***Description:***

The NoyaFeeReciever contract should use Ownable2Step instead of Ownable

**Impact:**
This is technically not a vulnerablity , but openZeppelin Ownable can lead to loss of contract ownership if ownership is transferred to a non-existent address. Ownable2step requires the reciever o confirm ownership. this insures against accidentally sending ownership to a mistyped address

### [QA-3] TITLE : Adherence to the Checks-Effects-Interactions(CEI) pattern;https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-noya/blob/9c79b332eff82011dcfa1e8fd51bad805159d758/contracts/helpers/OmniChainHandler/OmnichainLogic.sol#L83

***Description:***
This report analyzes the Omnichainlogic::startBridgeTransaction function, for adherence to the Checks-effects-Interactions pattern; the function initially isolated this pattern by updating the state after an external call. this report details the neccesary corrections, ensuring all state changes occur before any external Intercations, thereby enhancing the contract's security and robustness.

**Impact:**
Although the Omnichainlogic::startBridgeTransaction function uses a non-reentrancy guard, which mitigates the risk of reentrancy attacks, strictly following the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern is still important for coding best practices and ethical standards. Adhering to the CEI pattern ensures a clear and structured approach to function execution, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code. It also provides an additional layer of security, reinforcing the function's robustness against potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, even with the non-reentrancy guard in place, following the CEI pattern is a prudent practice that upholds high standards of smart contract development.

**Proof of Concept:**

<details>
<summary>code</summary>

```javascript
function startBridgeTransaction(BridgeRequest memory bridgeRequest) public onlyManager nonReentrant {
        bytes32 txn = keccak256(abi.encode(bridgeRequest));
        emit StartBridgeTransaction(bridgeRequest, txn);
        if (approvedBridgeTXN[txn] == 0 || approvedBridgeTXN[txn] + BRIDGE_TXN_WAITING_TIME > block.timestamp) {
            revert IConnector_BridgeTransactionNotApproved(txn);
        }
        if (bridgeRequest.from != address(this)) revert IConnector_InvalidInput();
        if (
            destChainAddress[bridgeRequest.destChainId] == address(0)
                || destChainAddress[bridgeRequest.destChainId] != bridgeRequest.receiverAddress
        ) {
            revert IConnector_InvalidDestinationChain();
        }
        approvedBridgeTXN[txn] = 0;
        swapHandler.executeBridge(bridgeRequest);
      @>  _updateTokenInRegistry(bridgeRequest.inputToken);
    }
```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:**

The call to swapHandler.executeBridge(bridgeRequest) happens before the internal call to _updateTokenInRegistry, which is a state change.
To strictly follow the CEI pattern, all state changes should be made before calling external contracts. Letâ€™s correct the function to adhere to the CEI pattern:

Corrected Function
solidity

```diff
function startBridgeTransaction(BridgeRequest memory bridgeRequest) public onlyManager nonReentrant {
        bytes32 txn = keccak256(abi.encode(bridgeRequest));
        emit StartBridgeTransaction(bridgeRequest, txn);
        if (approvedBridgeTXN[txn] == 0 || approvedBridgeTXN[txn] + BRIDGE_TXN_WAITING_TIME > block.timestamp) {
            revert IConnector_BridgeTransactionNotApproved(txn);
        }
        if (bridgeRequest.from != address(this)) revert IConnector_InvalidInput();
        if (
            destChainAddress[bridgeRequest.destChainId] == address(0)
                || destChainAddress[bridgeRequest.destChainId] != bridgeRequest.receiverAddress
        ) {
            revert IConnector_InvalidDestinationChain();
        }
        approvedBridgeTXN[txn] = 0;
+        _updateTokenInRegistry(bridgeRequest.inputToken);
        swapHandler.executeBridge(bridgeRequest);
-        _updateTokenInRegistry(bridgeRequest.inputToken);
    }
```
Changes Made:
Moved _updateTokenInRegistry(bridgeRequest.inputToken); before the call to swapHandler.executeBridge(bridgeRequest); to ensure all state updates are completed before interacting with external contracts.
Now, the function correctly follows the CEI pattern by performing all checks first, then updating the state, and finally interacting with external contracts.

```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:**
 AaveConnector::supply;

The function performs external interactions (IPool(pool).supply and registry.updateHoldingPosition) before completing all state changes.
According to CEI, state changes (effects) should happen before any external calls (interactions).
Corrected Function:
To follow the CEI pattern strictly, you should ensure all state changes occur before any external calls. Here is the revised version:

solidity

 ```diff
 function supply(
        address supplyToken,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
        _approveOperations(supplyToken, pool, amount);
+         _updateTokenInRegistry(supplyToken);
        IPool(pool).supply(supplyToken, amount, address(this), 0);
        registry.updateHoldingPosition(
            vaultId,
            registry.calculatePositionId(address(this), AAVE_POSITION_ID, ""),
            "",
            "",
            false
        );
-       _updateTokenInRegistry(supplyToken);
        emit Supply(supplyToken, amount);
    }   
```
AaveConnector::borrow;


The call to IPool(pool).borrow(_borrowAsset, _amount, _interestRateMode, 0,address(this)); happens before the internal call to _updateTokenInRegistry, which is a state change.
To strictly follow the CEI pattern, all state changes should be made before calling external contracts. Letâ€™s correct the function to adhere to the CEI pattern:

Corrected Function

```diff
 function borrow(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _interestRateMode,
        address _borrowAsset
    ) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
        if (!registry.isTokenTrusted(vaultId, _borrowAsset, address(this))) {
            revert IConnector_UntrustedToken(_borrowAsset);
        }
+         _updateTokenInRegistry(_borrowAsset);
        IPool(pool).borrow(
            _borrowAsset,
            _amount,
            _interestRateMode,
            0,
            address(this)
        );
        // get the health factor
        (, , , , , uint256 healthFactor) = IPool(pool).getUserAccountData(
            address(this)
        );
        if (healthFactor < minimumHealthFactor)
            revert IConnector_LowHealthFactor(healthFactor);
-        _updateTokenInRegistry(_borrowAsset);
        emit Borrow(_borrowAsset, _amount);
    }

```

AaveConnector::repay;

The function calls _approveOperations and then interacts with the IPool contract.
_updateTokenInRegistry(asset) is called after the external interaction.
To adhere strictly to the CEI pattern, all state changes should occur before any external interactions.

Corrected repay Function
To strictly follow CEI, we should ensure all internal state changes are done before any external calls:

solidity
```diff
 function repay(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 i
    ) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
        _approveOperations(asset, pool, amount);
+          _updateTokenInRegistry(asset);
        IPool(pool).repay(asset, amount, i, address(this));
-        _updateTokenInRegistry(asset);
        emit Repay(asset, amount, i);
    }

## [QA] Informational Findings on CamelotConnector.sol

## [QA-1] TITLE : Absence of Events for Liquidity Operations in CamelotConnector Contract

***Description:***
The CamelotConnector contract is designed to facilitate liquidity operations within the Camelot protocol. It includes functions for adding and removing liquidity from Camelot pools. However, the current implementation of the contract lacks event emissions for these liquidity operations, specifically within the `addLiquidityInCamelotPool` and `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool` functions. Events are essential in Solidity contracts for logging actions and state changes, enabling better transparency, debugging, and monitoring of contract activity.

**Impact:**
The absence of events for adding and removing liquidity has several critical impacts:

- Lack of Transparency: Stakeholders and users cannot easily track when liquidity is added or removed. This lack of transparency can erode trust in the system.
- Difficulty in Debugging: Without events, developers and auditors have a harder time tracing the flow of operations and diagnosing issues.
- Challenges in Monitoring: Automated monitoring tools and scripts that rely on events to track contract activities will not function correctly. This can hinder real-time monitoring and alerts for liquidity changes.
- Reduced Auditability: It becomes more difficult to perform audits and verify that the contract is functioning as intended without a detailed log of actions.
- Compliance and Reporting: For protocols that require detailed reporting for regulatory or compliance purposes, the absence of events can pose significant challenges.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
To address these issues, it is recommended to introduce event emissions in the `addLiquidityInCamelotPool` and `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool` functions. The events should capture relevant details of the liquidity operations to enhance transparency and traceability.

Example Mitigation:
Define Events:

solidity
Copy code
<details>
<summary>code</summary>

```javascript

event LiquidityAdded(
    address indexed tokenA,
    address indexed tokenB,
    uint256 amountA,
    uint256 amountB,
    uint256 minAmountA,
    uint256 minAmountB,
    uint256 deadline
);

event LiquidityRemoved(
    address indexed tokenA,
    address indexed tokenB,
    uint256 amountLiquidity,
    uint256 minAmountA,
    uint256 minAmountB,
    uint256 deadline
);
Emit Events in Functions:


function addLiquidityInCamelotPool(CamelotAddLiquidityParams calldata p) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
    _approveOperations(p.tokenA, address(router), p.amountA);
    _approveOperations(p.tokenB, address(router), p.amountB);
    router.addLiquidity(
        p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountA, p.amountB, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, address(this), p.deadline
    );
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenA);
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenB);
    registry.updateHoldingPosition(
        vaultId,
        registry.calculatePositionId(address(this), CAMELOT_POSITION_ID, abi.encode(p.tokenA, p.tokenB)),
        "",
        "",
        false
    );
@>    emit LiquidityAdded(msg.sender, p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountA, p.amountB, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, p.deadline);
}

function removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool(CamelotRemoveLiquidityParams calldata p) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
    address pool = factory.getPair(p.tokenA, p.tokenB);
    _approveOperations(pool, address(router), p.amountLiquidty);
    router.removeLiquidity(
        p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountLiquidty, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, address(this), p.deadline
    );
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenA);
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenB);
    if (IERC20(pool).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
        registry.updateHoldingPosition(
            vaultId,
            registry.calculatePositionId(address(this), CAMELOT_POSITION_ID, abi.encode(p.tokenA, p.tokenB)),
            "",
            "",
            true
        );
    }
@>    emit LiquidityRemoved(msg.sender, p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountLiquidty, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, p.deadline);
}
```
</details>


By implementing these changes, the CamelotConnector contract will enhance its transparency, traceability, and reliability, thereby increasing trust and ease of monitoring for all stakeholders.


## [QA-2] TITLE : Absence of NatSpec Documentation for addLiquidityInCamelotPool Function in CamelotConnector Contract


***Description:***
The CamelotConnector contract facilitates liquidity operations within the Camelot protocol, specifically through functions such as `addLiquidityInCamelotPool`. NatSpec (Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format) is a documentation standard used in Solidity to describe the functionality of code in a way that is easy for both developers and end-users to understand. The current implementation of the addLiquidityInCamelotPool function lacks NatSpec comments, which are crucial for providing clear, concise documentation directly within the code.

Impact:
The absence of NatSpec documentation in the `addLiquidityInCamelotPool` function has several notable impacts:

- Reduced Code Understandability: Developers and auditors may find it challenging to quickly grasp the purpose and mechanics of the function without detailed comments.
- Increased Onboarding Time: New team members or contributors may require additional time and resources to understand the codebase, slowing down development and collaboration.
- Poor User Documentation: End-users and integrators may lack essential information needed to interact with the contract effectively, potentially leading to misuse or errors.
- Difficulty in Maintenance: Lack of documentation can lead to maintenance challenges, as future modifications may be made without a full understanding of the original intent and functionality.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
To mitigate these issues, it is recommended to add comprehensive NatSpec documentation to the `addLiquidityInCamelotPool` function. This documentation should include descriptions of the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, and any relevant details about its behavior and requirements.

Example Mitigation:
Add NatSpec Comments:
solidity
Copy code
<details>
<summary>code</summary>

```javascript
/**
 * @notice Adds liquidity to a Camelot pool using the specified parameters.
 * @dev This function approves the token transfers and interacts with the Camelot router to add liquidity.
 * @param p The parameters for adding liquidity, encapsulated in a CamelotAddLiquidityParams struct.
 * - tokenA: The address of the first token.
 * - tokenB: The address of the second token.
 * - amountA: The amount of tokenA to add.
 * - amountB: The amount of tokenB to add.
 * - minAmountA: The minimum amount of tokenA expected to add.
 * - minAmountB: The minimum amount of tokenB expected to add.
 * - deadline: The timestamp by which the transaction must be completed.
 * Emits a {LiquidityAdded} event.
 */
function addLiquidityInCamelotPool(CamelotAddLiquidityParams calldata p) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
    _approveOperations(p.tokenA, address(router), p.amountA);
    _approveOperations(p.tokenB, address(router), p.amountB);
    router.addLiquidity(
        p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountA, p.amountB, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, address(this), p.deadline
    );
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenA);
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenB);
    registry.updateHoldingPosition(
        vaultId,
        registry.calculatePositionId(address(this), CAMELOT_POSITION_ID, abi.encode(p.tokenA, p.tokenB)),
        "",
        "",
        false
    );
    emit LiquidityAdded(msg.sender, p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountA, p.amountB, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, p.deadline);
}
```
</details>

Adding NatSpec documentation to the `addLiquidityInCamelotPool` function will significantly enhance the readability, maintainability, and usability of the CamelotConnector contract. This improvement ensures that developers, auditors, and end-users can easily understand and interact with the function, fostering better development practices and reducing potential for errors or misunderstandings.

By implementing the recommended NatSpec comments, the contract will align with best practices for Solidity development, providing clear and helpful documentation directly within the code.

The CamelotConnector contract is designed to handle liquidity operations within the Camelot protocol, including functions such as `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool`. NatSpec (Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format) is a crucial documentation standard in Solidity that helps describe the functionality of code in a manner that is easy to understand for both developers and end-users. The current implementation of the removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool function lacks NatSpec comments. The existing comments were copied from MaverickConnector contract and do not accurately describe the functionality of removing liquidity from Camelot pools.

Impact:
The lack of accurate NatSpec documentation for the `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool` function results in several negative impacts:

- Misleading Documentation: The copied comments can mislead developers, auditors, and users about the actual functionality of the `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool` function.
- Reduced Code Understandability: Developers and auditors may struggle to quickly understand the function's purpose and mechanics without detailed and accurate comments.
- Increased Onboarding Time: New team members or contributors will require additional time to comprehend the codebase, leading to slower development and collaboration.
- Poor User Documentation: End-users and integrators may lack essential information needed to interact with the contract effectively, potentially causing misuse or errors.
- Difficulty in Maintenance: Future maintenance becomes challenging without a full understanding of the original intent and functionality of the code.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To address these issues, it is recommended to replace the misleading comments with accurate NatSpec documentation tailored to the `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool` function. This documentation should describe the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, and relevant details about its behavior and requirements.

Example Mitigation:
Add Accurate NatSpec Comments:

solidity
Copy code
<details>
<summary>code</summary>

```javascript
/**
 * @notice Removes liquidity from a Camelot pool using the specified parameters.
 * @dev This function approves the token transfers and interacts with the Camelot router to remove liquidity.
 * @param p The parameters for removing liquidity, encapsulated in a CamelotRemoveLiquidityParams struct.
 * - tokenA: The address of the first token.
 * - tokenB: The address of the second token.
 * - amountLiquidty: The amount of liquidity tokens to remove.
 * - minAmountA: The minimum amount of tokenA expected to receive.
 * - minAmountB: The minimum amount of tokenB expected to receive.
 * - deadline: The timestamp by which the transaction must be completed.
 * Emits a {LiquidityRemoved} event.
 */
function removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool(CamelotRemoveLiquidityParams calldata p) external onlyManager nonReentrant {
    address pool = factory.getPair(p.tokenA, p.tokenB);
    _approveOperations(pool, address(router), p.amountLiquidty);
    router.removeLiquidity(
        p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountLiquidty, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, address(this), p.deadline
    );
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenA);
    _updateTokenInRegistry(p.tokenB);
    if (IERC20(pool).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
        registry.updateHoldingPosition(
            vaultId,
            registry.calculatePositionId(address(this), CAMELOT_POSITION_ID, abi.encode(p.tokenA, p.tokenB)),
            "",
            "",
            true
        );
    }
    emit LiquidityRemoved(msg.sender, p.tokenA, p.tokenB, p.amountLiquidty, p.minAmountA, p.minAmountB, p.deadline);
}
```

By adding accurate NatSpec documentation to the `removeLiquidityFromCamelotPool` function, the CamelotConnector contract will significantly enhance its readability, maintainability, and usability. This improvement ensures that developers, auditors, and end-users can easily understand and interact with the function, leading to better development practices and reducing the potential for errors or misunderstandings.

Implementing the recommended NatSpec comments aligns the contract with best practices for Solidity development, providing clear and helpful documentation directly within the code. This enhances the overall quality and reliability of the contract.
