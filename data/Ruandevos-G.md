Reduce Storage Operations: Ensure that storage operations are minimized, especially within loops and frequently-called functions.

Use of view and pure Functions: Identify functions that only read state but don't modify it. Declare them as view or pure accordingly.

Optimize Loops: Check for any loops in the code and ensure they are efficient. Nested loops can be particularly gas-intensive.

Batch External Calls: If there are multiple external calls, consider batching them into a single call to reduce gas costs.

Use memory Instead of storage: Where possible, use memory variables instead of storage to reduce gas costs.

Gas-Efficient Data Types: Ensure that gas-efficient data types are used where appropriate. For example, use uint256 instead of int256 if the variable is always positive.

Minimize Assertion Usage: Assertions consume gas. Ensure that assertions are only used where absolutely necessary.

Gas Limit Optimization: Ensure that the contract's operations can complete within the block gas limit. Consider breaking down large operations into smaller ones if necessary.function setUp() public {
    // Consider marking this function as `view` if it doesn't modify state.
    // The `console.log` statements could be removed in the production code to save gas.
    // Storage operations seem necessary for initialization but ensure they are optimized.
}

function testAaveDepositFlow() public {
    // Consider optimizing loop operations, especially in functions like `registry.getHoldingPositions`.
    // Ensure that external calls such as `connector.supply` and `connector.borrow` are optimized.
    // Evaluate the necessity of assertions and optimize them if possible.
}

function testHealthFactor() public {
    // Check the gas usage of the `connector.borrow` function, especially when it reverts.
    // Evaluate if the `connector.updateMinimumHealthFactor` function can be optimized.
}

function testDepositAndBorrowFlow() public {
    // Optimize loop operations and external calls.
    // Evaluate the gas usage of functions like `connector.supply`, `connector.borrow`, `connector.withdrawCollateral`, and `connector.repayWithCollateral`.
}

function testDepositAndRemovePosition() public {
    // Optimize loop operations and external calls.
    // Ensure that storage operations are minimized, especially in loops.
    // Evaluate the necessity of assertions and optimize them if possible.
}
