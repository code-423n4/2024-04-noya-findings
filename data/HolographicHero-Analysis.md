1. Access Control:
   - Both contracts use `onlyManager` modifier for critical functions which suggests there is some access control in place; ensure that manager roles are properly guarded.
   - There are also `nonReentrant` modifiers which are good for preventing re-entrancy attacks.
   
2. SafeERC20 Library:
   - It seems that the SafeERC20 library is being used, although the actual import statement is not visible. This is good for safe token transfers, approvals, etc.

3. Use of `forceApprove`:
   - The `stake` function in `AerodromeConnector.sol` uses `IERC20(pool).forceApprove(address(gauge), liquidity);` which is not a standard ERC20 function. Ensure that the `forceApprove` is properly implemented and is secure to use.

4. Reentrancy:
   - All sensitive external calls are guarded with `nonReentrant` which helps mitigate reentrancy attacks.

5. External Contract Interactions:
   - Interacting with multiple external contracts such as `IRouter`, `IVoter`, `IGauge`, and `IBalancerVault` increases the surface area for attacks. Make sure to handle failed external calls properly.

6. Unchecked External Data:
   - The contracts heavily depend on data from other contracts (`aerodromeRouter`, `voter`, `balancerVault`, etc.). Make sure that the data from these sources is validated.

7. Timestamp Dependence:
   - There's a `deadline` parameter used for both `supply` and `withdraw` functions. Check for any front-running attacks that might be possible due to block timestamp manipulations.

8. Hardcoded Position Types and Tokens:
   - The use of hardcoded values like `BALANCER_LP_POSITION` and token addresses (`BAL` and `AURA`) may affect the flexibility of the contract and its usage with different pools or reward tokens.

9. Error Handling & Emitting Events:
   - Ensure that events are emitted after state-changing operations to aid in tracking and transparency of contract operations.

10. Upgradability & Immutability:
    - Both contracts don't seem to provide a mechanism for upgrades, meaning if there's a bug, the contract might need to be redeployed and previous state/data migrated.

11. Calculating TVL:
    - The `_getPositionTVL` function in `BalancerConnector.sol` has complex calculations and relies on multiple external calls. Thorough testing with different scenarios is essential to ensure correctness.
